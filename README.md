## Hey mom look, no embedding space!

Hey sorry mom to dissapoint you but this is just a stupid way for reconstructing missing parts of images with long lasting training. I am very sorry to confess that the reconstruction must be for masks that are separated `mask_width` and `mask_height` pixels from the border of the image. My idea is like a transformer but way worse, but it works to some extent, so maybe tonight I get to eat my desert right? I mean it trains for 20 minutes to badly reconstruct missing parts, but it is cool, I guess...
